# Basic quadratic sieve implementation

These implementations take as input alarge number, and tries to output a prime factor of said number. There are two versions of this code, one in Python, and one in Rust, and they both do the same thing. I recommend reading the one in Rust, which is more readable and outputs more data.

This is based from the book "Prime Numbers, A Computational Perspective" by Richard Crandall and Carl Pomerance. I'm pretty sure nobody will read this, but hey for context that was my school project as a French exchange student in Germany.
